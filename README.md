# Find and Report Secrets in Code

- Founder: [Abdullah Khawer - LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdullah-khawer)

# Introduction

A security solution that finds secrets in a git repository using Gitleaks, generates a JSON report based on the findings from Gitleaks by extracting only the relevant information, finds the commit id and commit author for each finding, updates an Atlassian Confluence page with the secrets found based on that generated report and finally sends an alert on Slack.

‚ùì Where I can run this?

This solution can be executed on any macOS or Linux system either locally or on a remote server. It can also be executed on a CI/CD tool like on GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc, in a pipeline.

Below you can find an example of the JSON report generated:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "Detected a Generic API Key, potentially exposing access to various services and sensitive operations.",
    "File": "scripts/main.py",
    "Line No.": "11",
    "Link": "https://gitlab.com/my-projects/my-repo/-/blob/master/scripts/main.py#L11",
    "Secret Type": "generic-api-key",
    "Commit ID": "__REDACTED__",
    "Commit Author": "__REDACTED__",
    "Commit Author Email": "__REDACTED__"
  },
  {
    "Description": "Identified a HashiCorp Terraform password field, risking unauthorized infrastructure configuration and security breaches.",
    "File": "configurations/main.tf",
    "Line No.": "6",
    "Link": "https://gitlab.com/my-projects/my-repo/-/blob/master/configurations/main.tf#L6",
    "Secret Type": "hashicorp-tf-password",
    "Commit ID": "__REDACTED__",
    "Commit Author": "__REDACTED__",
    "Commit Author Email": "__REDACTED__"
  }
  ...
]
```

Note: In the actual execution, you will see the actual values instead of `__REDACTED__` values.

Below you can find examples of the Slack notification messages:

In case of no secrets found:

In case of 1 or more secrets found:

## Automatically via a CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions - Setup Instructions

In order to run it on any GitHub repository, add the following in the `.github-workflow.yml` file under the `.github/workflows/` directory in the repository:

```
name: find-and-report-secrets-in-code

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  find-and-report-secrets-in-code:
    uses: abdullahkhawer/find-and-report-secrets-in-code/.github/workflows/.github-workflow.yml@master
    with:
      CONFLUENCE_ENABLED: "1"
      CONFLUENCE_PAGE_TITLE: ${{ vars.CONFLUENCE_PAGE_TITLE }}
      CONFLUENCE_PAGE_SPACE: ${{ vars.CONFLUENCE_PAGE_SPACE }}
      SLACK_ENABLED: "1"
    secrets:
      CONFLUENCE_SITE: ${{ secrets.CONFLUENCE_SITE }}
      CONFLUENCE_USER_EMAIL_ID: ${{ secrets.CONFLUENCE_USER_EMAIL_ID }}
      CONFLUENCE_USER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CONFLUENCE_USER_TOKEN }}
      SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
      SLACK_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_API_TOKEN }}
```

In the `on` section, you specify events can cause the workflow to run. In the above example, the job is only allowed to execute if something is pushed to the `master` branch.

The variables referred using `$` are supposed to be created on the repository under `Repository secrets` and `Repository variables` depending on the type of variable from here: `Settings > Security > Secrets and variables > Actions`.

### GitLab CI - Setup Instructions

In order to run it on any GitLab repository, add the following in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file on root level in the repository:

```
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdullahkhawer/find-and-report-secrets-in-code/master/.gitlab/.gitlab-ci.yml'

stages:
  - scan

find-and-report-secrets-in-code:
  stage: scan
  extends:
    - .find-secrets:scan
  variables:
    CONFLUENCE_ENABLED: "1"
    CONFLUENCE_SITE: $CONFLUENCE_SITE
    CONFLUENCE_USER_EMAIL_ID: $CONFLUENCE_USER_EMAIL_ID
    CONFLUENCE_USER_TOKEN: $CONFLUENCE_USER_TOKEN
    CONFLUENCE_PAGE_TITLE: $CONFLUENCE_PAGE_TITLE
    CONFLUENCE_PAGE_SPACE: $CONFLUENCE_PAGE_SPACE
    SLACK_ENABLED: "1"
    SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
    SLACK_API_TOKEN: $SLACK_API_TOKEN
  retry:
    max: 2
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "schedule" && $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME == "master"
      when: always
      allow_failure: false
```

In the `rules` section, you specify rules for execution as `if` conditions. In the above example, the job is only allowed to execute if it is a scheduled job for the `master` branch.

The variables referred using `$` are supposed to be created on the repository under `CI/CD Variables` from here: `Settings > CI/CD > Variables`.

## Docker Image Details

The Docker image used is built using the Dockerfile that is present in this repository here: [Dockerfile](https://github.com/abdullahkhawer/find-and-report-secrets-in-code/tree/master/docker/Dockerfile)

Following build command is used on the root level in the GitHub repository: `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t "abdullahkhawer/find-and-report-secrets-in-code:latest" --no-cache -f ./docker/Dockerfile .`

The image used is publicly available here: [Docker - find-and-report-secrets-in-code](https://hub.docker.com/r/abdullahkhawer/find-and-report-secrets-in-code/)

For more details, check out its [README](https://github.com/abdullahkhawer/find-and-report-secrets-in-code/blob/master/docker/README.md).

## Notes

- A sample Gitleaks configuration file can be found here if interested in using it: `.gitleaks.toml`
- The Atlassian user should have access to the Confluence app, the `View` and `Add` permissions in the space on it and the `Can edit` permission on the page in that space. Also, you need to create an API token as the password won't work.
